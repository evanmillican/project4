      <h2>Where did they come from? And why are they so sad?</h2>
      <p>It started out as a niche trend on SoundCloud, a popular audio streaming and sharing platform, but emo-rap has taken over the charts and airwaves. It crept in slowly, you may not have even realized, but rap these days is… sad. Forget hitting up the club, or showing off your ice cream paint job, rappers these days are talking existentialism. Turn on the radio and you’ll hear Post Malone wailing about throwing it all away in his raspy, puedo-90s-grunge vocals, or Juice WRLD revealing a dependence on prescriptions and dealing with a broken heart. Sometimes it’s disguised with a catchy beat, but the heaviness and reality of rap music these days is hard to ignore. </p>
      <p>This is “emo-rap,” also referred to as “SoundCloud rap,” due to the overwhelming correlation of genre and platform. Traces of the subgenre can be traced back to before SoundCloud even existed, with artists promoting themselves on platforms like YouTube, but many credit Swedish rapper Yung Lean with the true conception of emo-rap around 2013. Along with his two producers, Yung Gud and Yung Sherman, Yung Lean formed Sad Boys, a group that pioneered what was then called “sad rap.” In 2016, the genre began to seriously take off. Rappers like Lil Pump and Lil Uzi Vert followed with huge hits and millions of listens on SoundCloud, their success due almost entirely to self-promotion on the platform. Within the past few years, many of these young rappers like Juice WRLD, Trippie Redd, and XXXTentacion have made the charts and gained some serious recognition; they are changing the landscape of rap music as we know it.</p>

      <p>While many of these artists have been picked up by huge labels and are selling tons of records, there is still a market for “underground” rappers, who typically stick to promoting their music on online audio sharing platforms, such as Soundcloud or last.fm. Here are the top 5 emo-rap artists according to last.fm:</p>

      <h2>In the News</h2>
      <p>After the explosion of the genre, the media has quickly picked up on this phenomenon of teenage, internet-famous, millionaire rappers. Many news outlets have been following the messy and controversial legal issues of Daniel Hernandez, or Tekashi 6ix9ine, as he is more commonly known. The media continues to focus on two of the most popular rappers in the genre, XXXtentacion and Lil Peep, who have both passed away within the past year and a half, but continue to have their music released, posthumously. The media will continue to cover the never-ending drama that follows these rappers as the genre becomes more and more mainstream.</p>
